# chaos-cloud

This is a skeleton repository. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap</b>

Want to design a program similar to Dropbox, but with a greater emphasis on user privacy. The code will be open source so that it can be inspected for compromised security and backdoors. All files will be encrypted on the client's computer before being uploaded to the cloud. Want to be minimal design so that individuals with underpowered hardware can still use without reduced performance.
